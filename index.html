                <h2>Today I am going to tell you about my favourite hobby which is playing piano and guitar!</h2>
                <p id="sentence">My hobby is to playing piano, guitar and sing. I like to play amazing songs on piano, I like to sing anywhere in the world. I am 12 years old and I study in suncity school, gurgaon and I am in 6th grade. Music is the art of arranging sounds in time to produce a composition through the elements of melody, harmony, rhythm, and timbre. It is one of the cultural universal aspects of all human societies. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "(art) of the Muses"); see § Etymology and glossary of musical terminology.</p><a class="more" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music#:~:text=Music%20is%20the%20art%20of,aspects%20of%20all%20human%20societies." target="_blank">Click here to learn more about music</a>
